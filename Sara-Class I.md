ilssear > And... it's too long LOL
Sara Seraph > it is  probably being saved already in save logs.. ducuments/eve/chatlogs...
ilssear > Sisters... [77]
Sara Seraph > so... loaded probes... gives you 77 strentgh...?
ilssear > vs Probe I [70]
Sara Seraph > 113...
Sara Seraph > take a quick look at the fitting...
Sara Seraph > top right.. aroulnd the circle...
Sara Seraph > no mwd...
ilssear > <url=showinfo:31213>Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I</url> incrases +10% the probe strength
Sara Seraph > no stabilizzer in low...
ilssear > <url=showinfo:33180>Scan Rangefinding Array I</url> x 3
Sara Seraph > but... this can work just data sites...
Sara Seraph > and.. I can probe to a solution 100% or sites in EVE
ilssear > and you have to be more alert and warp to bookmarks to prevent getting webbed
Sara Seraph > <url=showinfo:5599>Type-D Restrained Nanofiber Structure</url> in low... what is our max speed?
ilssear > 955.7 m/s
Sara Seraph > ilssear > and you have to be more alert and warp to bookmarks to prevent getting webbed<br>&lt;----  THIS!  this will save you  and is the key to being more than a good scout.
Sara Seraph > you will be an alive good scout.
ilssear > lol
Sara Seraph > agility..?
Sara Seraph > ab on...??  off?
Sara Seraph > <url=helpPointer:unique_UI_fittingNavigation>Fitting - Navigation Panel</url>
ilssear > off to warp, on to reach
Sara Seraph > what is the numbers..?
Sara Seraph > how many seconds now...?
ilssear > 455.6 m/s off
ilssear > 1205 overheat? what is that?
Sara Seraph > that is your velocity...  time to warp is?
Sara Seraph > overheating is like going maiximum miltary power...
ilssear > 3.6s to 5.16s
Sara Seraph > so now we are below 4 seconds...?
ilssear > wow, yes
Sara Seraph > so we have gone from 9 seconds... to... 4
Sara Seraph > over half
ilssear > <url=showinfo:5599>Type-D Restrained Nanofiber Structure</url> did the trick
Sara Seraph > <url=fitting:605:31238;1:31213;1:17938;1:439;1:33180;3:5533;2:22175;1:2486;7:30488;8:30013;16::>*EUNI - FD Explo Hero</url>
Sara Seraph > this is even more slightly different...
Sara Seraph > speeds and agility to warp...?
ilssear > I that the intertia modifier?
Sara Seraph > 455.6 to 425-iah..?
Sara Seraph > yes... the interia
ilssear > yes, from 319m/s to 455.6m/s with both Type-D's
Sara Seraph > how many seconds to warp out...?
ilssear > from 4.81 to 3.6s
Sara Seraph > so mine is 2.45 seconds
ilssear > And the AB does not affect the align time
Sara Seraph > Hmmmm...?
Sara Seraph > so it almost seems like the slower we are... the safer we are?  o?
ilssear > Weird....
ilssear > wait, I have an idea
ilssear > so, I canapproach a site warping in with a 70km distance to be safe, bookmark
ilssear > and then warp in and out to approach the site safer
ilssear > right?
Sara Seraph > yes...
Sara Seraph > and because I can warp in and out 'faste'....
Sara Seraph > faster*
ilssear > there must be a way to align bookmarks to a site toget closer to a site by changing the warp distance
ilssear > /emote is too tired to think
Sara Seraph > but I am 'slower' than the original ship we linked and chatted about...
ilssear > right
ilssear > but if the area is safe that shouldn't matter much
Sara Seraph > you are asking the correct answers... and... it wis what we will show you next time.. when we go to space
ilssear > I just turtle in to the containers
ilssear > :o
ilssear > brilliant
ilssear > You are the best
ilssear > but I need to get some sleep :D
Sara Seraph > let's sum up...
ilssear > it's 1:30 and I need to wake up at 6am
Sara Seraph > this is not my scouting clone...
ilssear > Let's recap and then some shuteye
ilssear > Which one is it?
Sara Seraph > <url=showinfo:33951//1044119993284>Low-grade Nomad Gamma</url>
Sara Seraph > this is my travelling fast clone... ;)
Sara Seraph > <url=showinfo:27188>Poteque 'Prospector' Astrometric Rangefinding AR-806</url> this makes my strength more than yours
Sara Seraph > so there are 'implants' to make us even better....
ilssear > Oh, cybernetics?
Sara Seraph > and very expensive...  so down the spacelanes...
ilssear > I'm going to need a sugar mommy
ilssear > :D
Sara Seraph > so altering th emodules in the slots can make our ship 'better'  and exploring seems to be going slower makes us 'faster'
ilssear > Or make me some ISKies
Sara Seraph > OK... questions...?
ilssear > And we can specialize for one type of site
ilssear > Does remapping help in here?
ilssear > it seems agility helps with the inertia









Sara Seraph > you can find me in the general and/or the Q&A  chats...


Sara Seraph > it could... but I do not recomend it at this time...
ilssear > got it
Sara Seraph > paying attention... and being fast to leave.. keeps you alive.
ilssear > You are amazing, thanks so much for your time
